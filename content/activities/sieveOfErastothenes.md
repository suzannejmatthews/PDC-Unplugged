## Details

Moore describes an example exercise that she presents in a parallel processing 
lab to illustrate data parallelism. Originally, the exercise is meant to 
distinguish between task parallelism and data parallelism; however, the task 
parallelism component is a bit weak, and so is not included here.

Prior to the start of the exercise, the instructor starts by writing as many 
integers as possible on the board (1-30 is recommended at the very least). To 
illustrate the data parallel model:

* students are selected to be processors, and the *n* values are divided amongst 
  the *s* students, so that each student has a partition of *n/s* of the data.

* Each student processor then marks the numbers in its portion of data that are divisible by 2, 3, 5, etc.

## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### Parallel Decomposition (Core Tier 2)

5\. Parallelize an algorithm by applying data-parallel decomposition.

---

## TCPP Topics Coverage

### TCPP Programming Topics

* Apply Data parallel: Be able to write a correct data parallel program for shared-memory machines and get speedup, should do an exercise.

## Recommended Courses

* Moore covers the concept in a parallel processing lab, though it is not 
  clear which course the lab was used in.

* **CS2/DSA/ProgLang** - TCPP recommends that data parallelism can be taught 
  in either CS2, DSA or programming languages.

## Accessibility

Since this activity requires students to mark values on a board in front of 
the classroom, it may be challenging for mobility-impaired students or blind 
students.

## Assessment 

Assessment of this particular exercise is unknown; (Moore2000) discusses the 
impact of the parallel computing labs in her course. In general, students 
responded to the labs positively, and felt that labs increased their knowledge 
significantly.
