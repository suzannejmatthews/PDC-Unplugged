## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### PD/Parallel Decomposition Core Tier 1

2\. Identify opportunities to partition a serial program into independent parallel modules. [Familiarity]

## TCPP Topics Coverage

### Algorithms Topics

* Know Selection: Observe algorithms for finding order statistics, 
  notably min and max. Understand that selection can always be accomplished 
  by sorting but that direct algorithms may be simpler. (0.5 hours)

## Recommend Courses
* **K-12**: This is an activity that can easily be done with K-12 students.
* **CS0/CS1/CS2**: The authors recommend introduction of the topic in these 
  undergraduate courses. The activity is easily scaled for large undergraduate 
  classrooms.
* **DSA**: TCPP recommends that DSA is a good place to introduce the concept 
  of selection.

## Accessibility: 

This activity seems appropriate for most populations.

* Deaf students can participate by signing the their age to their partner or 
  assistant.

* Blind students can participate by calling out their age.

* Students can stay in their seats, making it appropriate for students who are 
  mobility-impaired.

* Students who are deaf and blind may have issues with this activity. Braile 
  readers can be given a description of the prompt "state your age"; the 
  response can then be communicated to the people next to them.

## Assessment

Yes. This activity was assessed in an undergraduate PDC course in India (Chitra 2019), 
and CS1 and CS2 classes at Tennessee Tech (Ghafoor2019). In all cases, the 
unplugged activities were used to introduce students to the parallel concepts 
prior to "hands-on" programming exercises. The assessment results in both papers 
sugges that unplugged activities are a successful first start to teaching PDC 
computing concepts.
