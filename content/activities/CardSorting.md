### Variations
The concept of card sorting is described by (Moore2000). In a parallel 
processing lab, students form groups to develop card sorting algorithms to 
illustrate data parallelism in shared memory, data parallelism in message passing, and task parallelism for message 
passing. However, additional details on *how* exactly this is accomplished is 
not provided.

## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### Parallel Decomposition (Core Tier 1)

1. Explain why synchronization is necessary in a specific parallel program. [Usage]

2. Identify opportunities to partition a serial program into independent parallel modules. [Familiarity]


### Parallel Performance (Elective)

1. Detect and correct a load imbalance. [Usage]
2. Calculate the implications of Amdahl's law for a particular parallel algorithm (cross-reference SF/Evaluation for Amdahl's Law). [Usage]
3. Describe how data distribution/layout can affect an algorithm's communication costs. [Familiarity]

## TCPP Topics Coverage

### Algorithms Topics 
* Know Sorting: Observe several sorting algorithms for varied platforms --- 
  together with analyses. Parallel merge sort is the simplest example, 
  but equally simple alternatives for rings and meshes might be covered also; 
  more sophisticated algorithms might be covered in more advanced courses 
  (1 hour)

## Recommended Courses

* **CS0/CS1/CS2** - The authors suggest using the activity in introductory 
  computer science courses. In addition, there is assessment supporting this 
  approach.

* **DSA** - In addition to CS2, TCPP recommends that DSA may be an appropriate 
  place to cover sorting topics.

## Accessibility

Yes. This activity should be accessible to a wide range of students. The 
activity can easily be done at a table. Blind students can also participate 
in the exercise if Braille playing cards were used.

## Assessment 

Unknown. (Moore2000) discusses the impact of the parallel computing labs in 
her course. In general, students responded to the labs positively, and felt 
that labs increased their knowledge significantly.
