## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### Parallel Architecture (Elective)

8\. Describe the key performance challenges in different memory and distributed system topologies. [Familiarity]

---

## TCPP Topics Coverage

### Architecture Topics

* Know Message passing (no shared memory) Latency: Know the concept, 
  implications for scaling, impact on work/communication ratio to achieve 
  speedup.

* Know Message passing (no shared memory) Bandwidth: Know the concept, how it 
 limits sharing, and considerations of data movement cost.

---

## Recommended Courses

* Authors present the analogy to attendees of their "Supercomputing in Plain 
  English" workshop series. According to (Neeman2008), the concepts have been 
  presented to students as young as elementary school to adult attendees.

## Accessibility

Many younger students may struggle with this analogy. The age of cell phones and 
"unlimited" plans have hidden the notion of "long distance" costs and connection 
costs from students. In order to use this analogy, it is recommended that 
instructors first explain how phone calls *used* to be made.

## Assessment 

Unknown. (Neeman2006) describes the different analogies. There is no assessment 
provided in (Neeman2006) or (Neeman2008).
