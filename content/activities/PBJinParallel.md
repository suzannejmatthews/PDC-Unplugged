## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### Communication and Coordination (Core Tier 1)

2\. **Core Tier 1**: Give an example of an ordering of accesses among concurrent activities (e.g., program with a data race) that is not sequentially consistent. [Familiarity]

---

## TCPP Topics Coverage

### Programming Topics

* Comprehend Deadlocks: Understand what a deadlock is, and methods for detecting and preventing them

*  Know Data Races: Know what a data race is, and how to use synchronization to prevent it.

### Algorithms Topics

*  Know Synchronization: Be aware of methods for controlling race conditions (1 hour)

---

## Recommended Courses

* **CS0/CS1/CS2**: The authors recommend that the concepts are appropriate for 
  all these levels. Might be challenging to do with large classrooms (and 
  perhaps too messy).

* **DSA/Systems**: In addition to CS2, TCPP recommends that DSA and Systems 
  courses may be appropriate places to cover synchronization, race conditions, 
  and deadlock. 

* **OS**: Concepts may also be appropriate in an OS course 
  where concurrency issues such as deadlock and race conditions are being 
  discussed.

## Accessibility

The "sandwich" concept can be extended to other cheap ingredients, in case
particular students have nut allergies or other food-related allergies. The 
most important part is to have a limited set of "ingredient" resources, and 
multiple people trying to access those resources.

There is a lot of movement involved in this exercise; we recommend that 
mobility-impaired students be encouraged to take on the role of a 
single student making sandwiches.
