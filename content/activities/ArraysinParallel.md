## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### PD/Parallel Decomposition Core Tier1, Core Tier2



2\. **Core Tier 1**:Identify opportunities to partition a serial program into independent parallel modules. [Familiarity]

5.\ **Core Tier 2**:Parallelize an algorithm by applying data-parallel decomposition. [Usage]


## TCPP Coverage

### Programming Topics

* Apply Data parallel: Be able to write a correct data parallel program 
  for shared-memory machines and get speedup, should do an exercise. 
  Understand relation between different notations for data parallel: 
  **Array notations**, SPMD, and parallel loops. Builds on shared memory 
  topic above. (1 hour)


## Recommend Courses
* **CS0/CS1/CS2**: The activity authors recommend using this exercises in 
  in any of the introductory programming courses.

* **DSA/ProgLang**: In addition to CS2, TCPP recommends that the concept of 
  data parallel can be introduced in DSA or Programming Languages. For a large 
  course, the instructor can pick a few student volunteers to illustrate the 
  exercise to the rest of the class. 

## Accessibility 

This activity requires students to get up and go to a chalk board to complete 
exercise, and may be challenging for students who are mobility-impaired.
