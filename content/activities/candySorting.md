## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### Parallel Decomposition (Core Tier 1, Core Tier 2)

1\. **Core Tier 1**: Explain why synchronization is necessary in a specific parallel program. [Usage]

2\. **Core Tier 1**: Identify opportunities to partition a serial program into independent parallel modules. [Familiarity]

4\. **Core Tier 2**: Parallelize an algorithm by applying task-based decomposition. [Usage] 

### Parallel Performance (Elective)

1\. Detect and correct a load imbalance. [Usage]

3\. Describe how data distribution/layout can affect an algorithm's communication costs. [Familiarity]

## TCPP Topics Coverage

### Programming Topics

* Comprehend Computation (decomposition strategies): Understand different ways to assign computations to threads or processes.

* Comprehend Load balancing: Understand the effects of load imbalances on performance, and ways to balance load across threads or processes (1 hour).

---

## Recommended Courses

* **CS0/CS1/CS2**: The authors recommend using this activity in introductory 
  computing course. This activity has been assessed in a CS1/CS2 course.
* **DSA**: In addition to CS2, TCPP suggests DSA as an appropriate place to cover task decomposition and load balancing topics.

## Accessibility

May be difficult for color-blind students. In the case that there are 
color-blind students, we recommend using a range of treats that are 
differentiated by shape rather than color. This will also help students 
who are Blind with the sorting.

## Assessment 

Yes. In (Ghafoor2019), the candy sorting exercise was used to introduce 
parallel programming concepts in CS1 and CS2. The evaluation performed by 
the authors suggest that the use of unplugged activities make it easier to 
learn parallel computing concepts.
