## TCPP Coverage

### Algorithms: 
* Know Sorting: Observe several sorting algorithms for varied platforms --- 
  together with analyses. Parallel merge sort is the simplest example, but 
  equally simple alternatives for rings and meshes might be covered also; more 
  sophisticated algorithms might be covered in more advanced courses (1 hour)

## Recommended Courses

* **K-12**: CSUnplugged recommends this as a K-12 activity. 
* **CS1/CS2/DSA**: The activity can be used to introduce students to parallel 
  sorting concepts in undergraduate courses, but is inappropriate for large 
  classes.

## Accessibility
This exercise requires movement and visuals. For those who are 
mobility-impaired, the exercise can be done on paper instead, or through 
Second Life (Bell 2009). Disabled students experiencing the exercise in 
Second Life reported enjoying the activity (Manabe 2011).
