## CS2013 Knowledge Unit Coverage

### PD/Communication and Coordination Core Tier 2

3. Give an example of a scenario in which blocking message sends can deadlock. [Usage]

## TCPP Coverage

### Programming Topics

* Comprehend Deadlocks: Understand what a deadlock is, 
and methods for detecting and preventing them

## Recommended Courses

* **K-12**: CSUnplugged recommends this as a K-12 activity
* **Systems/OS**: The activity can also be used to introduce the concepts of 
  concurrency and deadlock in undergraduate courses. However, this is an 
  activity that is best for small numbers of students. For larger classrooms, 
  it is recommended to split the students into several groups and have each 
  group perform the activity. 

## Accessibility:

This exercise requires visuals, and may not be friendly to blind students.
