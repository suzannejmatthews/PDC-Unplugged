## What is PDC Unplugged?

PDC Unplugged is a free resource for educators looking to integrate more PDC 
into their classrooms. We curate a collection of unplugged activities from the 
literature and around the web. Educators are free to use whichever activities 
they please, provided that they cite the source papers and PDC Unplugged.
