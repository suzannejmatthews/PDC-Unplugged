      <description>Original Author/link Described by Yifat Ben-David Kolikant (Kolinkat2001). Two introduction questions presented by Steven Bogaerts as part of his &amp;ldquo;real-life analogies&amp;rdquo; (Bogaerts2014, Bogaerts2017).
No public description avaialable. See Details section for more information.
 Details Start with some generals questions from Steven Bogaerts:
 &amp;ldquo;If I can shovel my driveway in 1 hour, how long would you expect it to take if someone equally capable were to help me?&amp;rdquo;
  &amp;ldquo;If one person can dig a hole with a shovel in 100 seconds, how long will it take for 10 people to dig that hole?</description>

 Details The company analogy is used to introduce multicore systems:
 The processor is a &amp;ldquo;company&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;desks&amp;rdquo; representing multiple cores. Students (&amp;ldquo;employees&amp;rdquo;) are assigned/hired to sit at a desk to do work, representing threads (or processes). Work is written on &amp;ldquo;job cards&amp;rdquo; and represent tasks/runnables to be executed.</description>
