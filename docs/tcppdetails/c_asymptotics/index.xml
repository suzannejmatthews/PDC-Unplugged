      <description>Original Author/link Originally Described by Adam Rifkin (Rifkin1994), with a separate description by Michelle Moore (Moore2000). (Bachelis1994) also presents the sort as a &amp;ldquo;compare-exchange sort&amp;rdquo;. We extrapolate on (Rifkin1994), since it is well described.
No web-link to independent description available. However, (Sivilotti2003) employed the exercise in a summer workshop for middle school girls, and provided a write-up of the activity and slides associated with the activity at his website:
