Paper available online:
 Details See paper for full details. This activity demonstrates how an algorithm can recover from data corruption. The students in this activity represent processes in an undirected connected graph. Each process has a unique identifier. The goal is to identify the process with the highest identifier. While the process identifiers themselves are not corruptible, the model assumes that transient faults may occur that can corrupt data values associated with the process.</description>

Paper and poster available online:
 Details See paper for details. In summary, this activity presents a directed graph with a distinguished vertex (labeled the root). Vertices are connected to each other with some number of edges. The end-goal is determine the set of reachable vertices from the root (&amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo;) and distinguish them from the set of non-reachable vertices (&amp;ldquo;garbage&amp;rdquo;).</description>

No web-link to independent description available. See paper (Ben-Ari1999) for additional details.
 Details The paper uses dramatizations to help students understand algorithmic execution. The paper only describes one such lesson, which is used to introduce the concept of mutual exclusion. The following is a rough summary of the exercise in (Ben-Ari1999):
Two students volunteer to be robots. A drinking glass is placed at a visible point in the classroom, purporting to contain &amp;ldquo;juice&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Original Author/link Note: The &amp;ldquo;Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich&amp;rdquo; serial exercise is an extremely old way to describe how a computer executes a set of instructions. The earliest known description is the &amp;ldquo;Great Peanut Butter Caper&amp;rdquo; by Lewandowski and Morehead in 1998. A variation was presented by Davis and Rebelsky in 2007. Unlike the original described exercises, this activity explores how to put together a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich in parallel</description>
