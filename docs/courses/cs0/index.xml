Details See paper for details. In summary, the goal is to find the oldest penny in a pile of pennies. This is first done sequentially, with one student trying to determine the oldest penny in a group of 50 pennies. Next, two students are employed, with each student getting a bag of 25 pennies.</description>

 Available in: PPT and PDF Also described in (Neeman2006)  After the first game (Take the Pen), students are asked &amp;ldquo;Can the outcome be predicted in advance?&amp;rdquo; They are led to the answer &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;, and to understand this is situation represents a race condition (Neeman2006).
The question is repeated after the second game (Look at the Pen).</description>

      <description>Original Author/link Note: The &amp;ldquo;Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich&amp;rdquo; serial exercise is an extremely old way to describe how a computer executes a set of instructions. The earliest known description is the &amp;ldquo;Great Peanut Butter Caper&amp;rdquo; by Lewandowski and Morehead in 1998. A variation was presented by Davis and Rebelsky in 2007. Unlike the original described exercises, this activity explores how to put together a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich in parallel</description>
