      <description>Original Author/link Originally described by Steve Bogaerts (Bogaerts2014).
No link to independent description publicly available. See &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; section for more details:
Details Bogaerts used this analogy to explain the notion of thread join operation. Suppose a parent and their child are out for a walk along a trail in their local park. The child decides to travel off the path to pick flowers. While the parent can go on for some time without the child, eventually they will call out to the child to catch up: &amp;ldquo;Come now, please join me up here&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Details Students sitting at desks represent &amp;ldquo;threads&amp;rdquo; on individual cores. Each student has a piece of paper on their desk representing local memory. Prior to the activity, the instructor writes an array on the board, filled with random values (limit 1 through 10 for ease of addition), with indices written underneath.</description>

      <description>Original Author/link The kitchen analogy is a fairly well-known analogy for discussing the memory hierarchy. I am not sure who first described it. If someone knows, please contact me so I can attribute correctly
There are several on-line write-ups about the Kitchen Analogy. We specifically link to a series of blog-posts on the Kitchen Analogy that were posted on the Intel Developers Site in 2015, as it is one of the most well-developed write-ups of the analogy that I have seen thus far:</description>
