 Details The instructor plays the role of the main program, and students play the role of one or more acrobats.
  The instructor chooses a few student volunteers to be &amp;ldquo;acrobats&amp;rdquo;. It is very important that the instructor knows the names of the students (and that they have different names).</description>

      <description>Original Author/link Originally described by Steve Bogaerts (Bogaerts2014).
No link to independent description publicly available. See &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; section for more details:
 Details Bogaerts used this analogy to explain the notion of thread join operation. Suppose a parent and their child are out for a walk along a trail in their local park. The child decides to travel off the path to pick flowers. While the parent can go on for some time without the child, eventually they will call out to the child to catch up: &amp;ldquo;Come now, please join me up here&amp;rdquo;.</description>

 Details This analogy is used to explain the mechanism of locks. While (Bogaerts2014) specifically references the book The Lord of the Flies, not everyone may be familiar with that book (and some who are already familiar may not want to be reminded of it). Instead, it may be useful to explain the following general scenario:</description>

 &amp;ldquo;If I can shovel my driveway in 1 hour, how long would you expect it to take if someone equally capable were to help me?&amp;rdquo;
  &amp;ldquo;If one person can dig a hole with a shovel in 100 seconds, how long will it take for 10 people to dig that hole?</description>

TCPP Coverage Algorithms:  Know Sorting: Observe several sorting algorithms for varied platforms &amp;mdash; together with analyses. Parallel merge sort is the simplest example, but equally simple alternatives for rings and meshes might be covered also; more sophisticated algorithms might be covered in more advanced courses (1 hour)  Recommended Courses  K-12: CSUnplugged recommends this as a K-12 activity. CS1/CS2/DSA: The activity can be used to introduce students to parallel sorting concepts in undergraduate courses, but is inappropriate for large classes.</description>
