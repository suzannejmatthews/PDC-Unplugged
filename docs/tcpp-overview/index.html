<h1>TCPP View</h1>

 <p>This view classifies PDC unplugged activities by their classification according to the <a href="https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/" target=_blank>NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel 
   and Distributed Computing</a> (TCPP 2012) which aims to articulate the core PDC areas that an undergraduate computer science student should cover in the course 
   of their undergraduate education. The TCPP report informed the creation of the PD topic area in CS2013, and lists several cross-cutting topics. For the immediate, our 
   focus is on identifying unplugged activities that satisfy each of topics suggested for Core courses (CS1, CS2, Systems and DS/A); Advanced/Elective courses are not 
   covered. Bloom's Taxonomy is used by TCPP to help solidify the level of coverage of each topic:</p>
   <p><ul>
    <li><b>Know</b>: Know the term (basic literacy)</li>
    <li><b>Comprehend:</b> Comprehend so as to paraphrase/illustrate</li>
    <li><b>Apply:</b> Apply it in some way (requires operational command)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Each topic is preceded by one of these terms. Use the Bloom taxonomy classification to gauge the level of topic coverage in a course.</p>

<tr><td> <u>Comprehend Concurrency, Asynchrony, Dependencies, and Nondeterminism</u>: Qualitatively understand the notion of concurrency, asynchrony, dependencies, and nondeterminism through one or more every day examples illustrating simultaneous events with dependencies. The examples can be non-computational in CS1; for example, preheating the oven and preparing the batter for a cake can proceed concurrently and asynchronously to save time, but both these events must finish before baking starts (dependency). Computational  examples of the appropriate level can be used in CS2.

<tr><td> <u>Know Parallel Prefix (Scan)</u>: Observe, via examples this "high-level" algorithmic tool. For instance, polynomial evaluation can be done as a prefix product (of powers of x), then a set of multiplications, followed by a reduction.</td><td>DSA</td><td></td></tr>

Illustrate using block matrix transpose or shuffle from map-reduce, etc.</td><td>CS2/DSA</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> <u>Comprehend Mutual Exclusion and Conflict Resolution</u>: 
Understand the need to resolve conflicts among concurrent processes competing for a shared resource.

<tr><td> <u>Comprehend Reduction and Broadcast for communication and synchronization</u>: Understand, for example, how recursive doubling can be used for all-to-one reduction, and its dual, one-to-all reduction, in log(p) steps.  The same applies to all-to-all broadcast and all-to-all reduction. Be aware of the synonyms for these operations in the jargon associated with different areas; for example, all-to-all broadcast may be referred to as "gossip" or "total exchange". Recognize that all-to-all broadcast/reduction are synchronizing operations in a distributed (event-driven) environment.</td><td>DSA</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> <u>Comprehend Parallel Prefix (Scan)</u>: Understand the structure of at least one simple parallel prefix algorithm, for example, on a PRAM-type model. One could consider recursive or iterative approaches (such as those of Ladner-Fischer, Kogge-Stone, Brent-Kung)</td><td>DSA</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> <u>Know Termination detection</u>: Observe that, unlike the sequential case, processes in parallel and distributed algorithms may not know when the problem has been solved, or even if their part of the problem is solved; so termination has to be addressed explicitly. In some cases (such as reduction, tree algorithms, divide and conquer) it may be possible for a process to terminate on the basis of local information (for example, a node has passed its information to its parent in a reduction tree). In other cases, a global check may be necessary.</td><td>DSA</td><td></td></tr>

Parallel merge sort is the simplest example, but equally simple alternatives for rings and meshes might be covered also; more sophisticated algorithms might be covered in more advanced courses</td><td>CS2/DSA</td>

Comprehend the notion of efficient algorithms (e.g., Bloom filters, heavy hitters) and structures (e.g., distributed hash tables) for stream data, and the difficulty of dealing with limited space.</td><td>CS1/DSA</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> <u>Apply Deeper Algorithmic Experience</u>: 
Experience through class instruction and assignment/project the design, analysis, and implementation aspects of at least one parallel or distributed algorithm of choice in detail.
