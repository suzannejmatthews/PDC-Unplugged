<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>From (Bachelis1994):
The goal is to add a series of 16 random numbers. Each student is given a piece of paper (representing local memory) that only they have access to. Addition can only be performed between two numbers at any given time, and it assumed that it takes the same amount of time to add any two numbers. Thus, one addition operation takes one time step. The processor therefore employs a series of addition operations to
to add the collection of numbers. Each number is written down on a separate card. Note cards are also provided for &ldquo;message passing&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="serial-case">Serial case:</h3>
<ul>
<li>One student is given the set of 16 random numbers and is asked to add them up.</li>
<li>Student should recognize that to add 16 numbers, it takes a total of 15 addition operations.</li>
<li>Ask the students: <em>how to make the process faster?</em></li>
<li>The answer is to to use several processors and a &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; methodology.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="parallel-case">Parallel Case</h3>
<p><strong>Two Students</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each student is given a subset of 8 numbers.</li>
<li>Each student adds their 8 numbers together on their own piece of paper. Student 1 then writes their total on a note-card and hands it to student 2. Student 2 then adds their total with the total they received<br>
from student 1 to yield the final total. The class should note that this total is equal to total achieved during the serial run.</li>
<li>Ask the students: <em>how many time steps did this require?</em></li>
<li>Answer: To add 8 numbers, a total of 7 addition operations are required. Since each student performed their additions simultaneously and in parallel, a total of 7 time steps are required. The final global
sum requires an additional time step. Therefore 8 total time steps are required, plus any overhead for the message by student 1 to student 2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Four Students</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each student is assigned a number (1..4) and is given a subset of 4 numbers to add up.</li>
<li>Each student adds up their 4 numbers (using their piece of paper). At the end, students 1 writes their total on an index card and hands it to student 2, who computes a new total using their total and the
total received from student 1. Likewise, student 3 writes down their computed total won an index card and hands it student 4, who computes a new total by adding their total to the one received from student 3.
Lastly, student 2 writes their new total on another index card and hands it to student 4, who computes the final total. The class should note that this amount is the same as the total value achieved before.</li>
<li>Ask the students: <em>how many time steps did this require?</em></li>
<li>Answer: Each student initially takes 3 addition operations to add 4 numbers. Since the students performed their comparisons simultaneous and in parallel, a total of three time steps are needed for this step.
Next, the communication of the sum from student 1 to 2 happen independently from the communication of the sum from student 3 to student 4, and students 2 and 4 compute their sums independently. Therefore, this step can also happen in parallel, and takes an additional time step (exclusive of communication costs). The final sum between students 2 and 4 requires on last time step. Therefore, the total number of time steps is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5, not including the overhead of message communication. Students should recognize that the number of &ldquo;messages&rdquo; sent by students have grown.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eight students</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each student is assigned a number (1..8) and given a subset of two cards.</li>
<li>Each student adds their two numbers together. Then: Student 1 sends their total to Student 2, Student 3 sends their total to Student 4, Student 5 sends their total to Student 6, Student 7 sends their total to
Student 8.</li>
<li>During the next time step, Students 2, 4, 6, and 8 adds the number they receive with their total to produce new totals. Then, Student 2 sends their new total to Student 4, and Student 6 sends their
total to Student 8.</li>
<li>During the next time step, Students 4 and 8 add the numbers they receive to their totals to produce new totals. Then, Student 4 sends their new total to Student 8.</li>
<li>During the last time step, Student 8 adds their total with the number they received from Student 4. This is the final total. Students should note that this total matches the totals computed in the 1, 2, and 4
processor scenarios.</li>
<li>Ask the students: <em>how many time steps does this require?</em></li>
<li>Answer: Each student requires one time add 2 numbers. Since the students performed their comparisons simultaneous and in parallel, a total of 1 time step is needed for this initial step. Next, the  addition
of student 1 and 2&rsquo;s totals happen independently from the sums of students 3 and 4&rsquo;s totals, and student 5 and 6&rsquo;s totals, and students 7 and 8&rsquo;s totals. These additions all happen in parallel, and take an additional time step. Next, the summing of the totals for students 2 and 4 happen independently from the summing of the totals of students 6 and 8. These additions therefore happen in parallel, and take an
additional time step. The final addition of the totals of students 4 and 8 requires one additional time step. Therefore, the total number of time steps is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, excluding communication costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class then should asked to calculate the speedup of the parallel cases over the serial cases. The students should see that speedup is not linear, and that the addition of more processors does incur heavier
communication cost. To make the example more concrete, assign a cost to each communication component (0.5 time step). Then ask students to recompute time steps and speedup. This should help students clearly
observe the cost of communication overhead.</p>
