<p>Originally described by William S. Lloyd (Lloyd1994)</p>
<p>No web-link to independent description available. See paper (Lloyd1994)
for additional details.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Students learn of the classic Byzantine Generals problem by acting out
scenarios.</p>
<p>The Byzantine Generals problem is a classic description of the consensus
problem in distributed computing, where many independent processes must agree
on a &ldquo;true&rdquo; value for a particular measurement (especially in the case where
some processes become unreliable due to faults). Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
describes fault tolerance to &ldquo;Byzantine&rdquo; faults, where a rogue process may
(instead of gracefully failing) continue to generate arbitrary data, making it
difficult to detect as a faulty process.</p>
<p>Today, the Byzantine General problem and BFT has its most well-known application
in the creation of the Bitcoin, where the Byzantine-tolerant block-chain enables
the generation of a consensus of the system&rsquo;s state at any given time.</p>
<p>Prior to the activity, students are familiarized with the conspiracies of
the Byzantine Empire. (Lloyd1994) suggests telling the story of Empress Irene
of Athens, who ruled in stead of her underage son, Constantine VI from 780-790 AD.
When Constantine assumed power, Irene was deposed and exiled. Through a
conspiracy, Irene re-seized the throne in 797 AD, gouging out her son&rsquo;s eyes to
prevent him from retaking the throne (he succumbed to his wounds days later).
Irene herself was overthrown by conspiracy in 802 AD.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-the-problem">Introducing the Problem</h3>
<p>The Byzantine generals problem is then introduced through the following
scenario. It is midnight, and the Byzantine army is preparing to attack
an enemy fort at dawn. The armed forces are split into several brigades,
each led by its own general and occupying separate hills surrounding the fort.
Each general must remain with his or her troops, and communicates with other
generals by utilizing messengers that run from camp to camp. The generals
must come to agreement on whether to attack at first light or retreat. The
enemy&rsquo;s strength is such that unless a majority of the brigades attack,
it will be a total rout and the Byzantine army will suffer a major defeat. The
generals have agreed to abide by the vote of the majority, and will retreat
if a majority decision cannot be reached.</p>
<p>While the army&rsquo;s lines of communication are secure (the messengers carry
unforgeable messages stamped with the seal of the sender), there is a very
real possibility that one or more of the Byzantine generals are traitors to the
realm. For example, the traitors may trick a few of the loyal generals in
attacking when the general consensus is to retreat, leading to a major
military defeat. The problem is this: how can a loyal general ensure that
his or her decision is the same as the majority of generals? What plan can
be devised to ensure that the honest general will be joined by all loyal brigades
to attack?</p>
<h3 id="the-activity">The Activity</h3>
<p>The instructor should start by choosing three students to play generals, and
have them stand in different corners of the classroom. A separate student is
picked to act as a runner carrying messages between generals.</p>
<p>Ask the class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t a general make a decision on a single message received from
the others?</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the case where students A and B are loyal and C is a traitor. A
wants to attack, and B wants to retreat. In a simple &ldquo;majority vote&rdquo; situation,
all C needs to do is send an attack message to A to trick A into attacking,
and a retreat message to B (or no message) to trick B into retreating. It may
be helpful to write the messages received by each general on the board in
separate columns (for example, A&rsquo;s column will read: A - Attack, B - retreat,
C-attack, consensus - Attack).</p>
<p>Next, the students are asked to consider the scenario where a fourth general
(D) is added (pick a new student to play this part, and have them stand in a fourth
corner of the room). Like general A, suppose general D also favors an attack.</p>
<p>Ask the class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose the new general D is loyal. Is it possible for general C to succeed
in his or her treachery?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is yes. All C needs to do is send A an attack message, and B and
D to retreat. A will receive three attack messages (from A and D), and, having
three of the four generals in agreement, prepare to attack. B and D however,
will receive two votes for attack (from A and/or D) and two votes for retreat
(from B and C). As a reminder, the decision is to retreat in the case of ties.
Therefore, come morning, general A will attack alone while B, C, and D retreat.</p>
<p>Next, ask the students:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority method fails. What is the best way to foil the traitors plans?</li>
</ul>
<p>With some guidance, students should come up with the solution that generals
should circulate another round of messages, comparing notes to ensure that
each general voted the same way in all messages. Thus, in the next round, all
the generals send out the votes received by all the other generals.</p>
<p>Each loyal general determines the &ldquo;true&rdquo; vote of another general by seeing how
the general voted to everyone else. So, A may write the following:
(A): A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Attack, D - Retreat; (B): A- Attack, B -
Retreat, C - Retreat, D - Retreat; (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) A- Attack, B- Retreat C-(Attack or Retreat), D - Retreat;
(D) A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Retreat, D - Retreat.</p>
<p>Based on this, general A can see that generals B and D always indicates retreat,
while C either indicates attack (50%) of the time, or retreat (75%) of the time.
Therefore C&rsquo;s vote is recorded as retreat. General A can then note one attack
vote (from A) and three retreat votes (from B, C, and D), and determine that
it is best to retreat.</p>
<p>Next ask the students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose there are <em>two</em> traitors  (a conspiracy!), and that D is also a
traitor just like C. Can general A still be tricked? Is there a way to foil
the attack?</li>
</ul>
<p>With two traitors, it is even easier to fool A into attacking, and B into
retreating. A can be sent the messages from C and D saying to attack, while
sending B messages to retreat. However, the exchanging of messages does
not work this time. Consider the following scenario where C and D send
A the message attack, and send B the message to retreat. A will therefore
write the following:</p>
<p>(A): A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Attack, D - Attack; (B): A- Attack, B -
Retreat, C - Retreat, D - Retreat; (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) A- Attack, B- Retreat C-Attack, D - Attack;
(D) A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Attack, D - Attack.</p>
<p>From this set of messages, it will appear to A that C and D are indicating that
they will attack (even though B correctly reports that C and D sent a message
indicating that they are retreating). So, A will attack.</p>
<p>In contrast, B may write the following:</p>
<p>(A): A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Attack, D - Attack; (B): A - Attack, B - Retreat,
C - Retreat, D-Retreat. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Retreat D - Retreat,
(D) A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Retreat, D-Retreat.</p>
<p>In this case, B is fooled into thinking that C and D are in agreement of
retreating, and will retreat. In the case of two traitors, it is impossible
for them to be overcome.</p>
<p>Lastly, ask general D to sit down. Ask the class:</p>
<ul>
<li>What about the original scenario with three generals (A, B, and C) and only
one disloyal general. Can the traitor still be detected?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first round of messages, C can tell A to attack and B to retreat. In
the second round however, C can forward seperate messages to A and B.</p>
<p>A could then write the following:
(A): A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Attack; (B): A - Attack, B - Retreat,
C - Retreat; (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Attack.</p>
<p>In this scenario, while B correctly reports that C told them to retreat, the
majority decision for C is two attacks and one retreat. So, A will interpret
C&rsquo;s decision as &ldquo;attack&rdquo;, and will attack.</p>
<p>Likewise, B can write the following:
(A): A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Attack; (B): A - Attack, B - Retreat,
C - Retreat; (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) A - Attack, B - Retreat, C - Retreat.</p>
<p>In this case, while A correctly reports that C reported to attack, the majority
of B&rsquo;s messages indicate that C indicates to retreat. Therefore, B will
interpret C&rsquo;s decision as &ldquo;retreat&rdquo;, and will retreat.</p>
<p>Conclude with the fact that in order for loyal generals to defeat traitors,
there must be at least over three times as many loyal generals as traitors (i.e.
3_t_ +1, where <em>t</em> is the number of traitors). (Lloyd1994) also recommends
telling students that while the above dramatization is useful for exploring
the problem, formal proof methods are necessary to make the argument
correctly to computer scientists.</p>
<h3 id="relating-it-to-distributed-computing">Relating it to Distributed Computing</h3>
<p>Each general represents a process executing on a separate distributed
processor. A traitor represents an unpredictably faulty processor. The entire
army represents a distributed computer system in which separate elements
cooperate to achieve a task. Prime questions for discussion include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The generals work <em>concurrently</em> to make their decisions. When is <em>concurrency</em>
useful in computing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generals cooperate through they are in different camps. How to
processes executing on different processors form a distributed computing
system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generals communicate through runners. How do distributed processes
communicate? What are the effects of interprocess communication on security?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Byzantine army can be effective even though some generals are traitors.
How can distributed systems increase reliability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose instead that the enemy captures/corrupts a runner. What kinds of
failures can occur in distributed computing systems?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, the instructor can guide discussions on more advanced issues related
to viruses, hacking, and encryption. For example, message passing amongst
generals can be used to illustrate encryption techniques. Lastly, the
instructor can relate the Byzantine General problem to the construction of the
block-chain.</p>
