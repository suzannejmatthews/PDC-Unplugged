<p>Originally Described by Michelle Moore (Moore2000). In a separate paper (Kitchen1992), the notion of adding numbers in a matrix to illustrate master/worker
is alluded to, but not discussed in depth.</p>
<p>No web-link to independent description available. See paper (Moore2000) for

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Moore describes how to use Matrix Addition to describe the differences
between shared memory vs distributed memory systems. Prior to the start
of the exercise, the instructor writes <em>N</em> x <em>N</em> matrices A and B on the board,
along with an empty matrix C of the same dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Memory</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One student is designated as the master. He or she picks a team of students to
help and splits up the <em>N</em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cells of matrix A between them. The cells
the students are assigned in A are the same cells they are assigned in B.</li>
<li>Each student is responsible to add up their corresponding cells in A and B and
write the result in C.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, each student represents a thread, with the board representing shared
memory. If there are too many students up on the board, many will start
bumping into each other, signifying resource contention. Assigning fewer
students (say one student per row) will likely lead to less contention.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Memory</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One student is designated as the master process and stands at the front of
the classroom next to the board. He or she picks a subset of students at
their desks to help; these student helpers remain at their desk.</li>
<li>The student representing the master process splits up the matrix and hands
each student helper the set of calculation to perform, including giving
themselves some work.</li>
<li>Once each student finishes their work, they hand their computations to the
master. The master then writes the result in the corresponding cell in
matrix C on the board.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, each student represents a process (sitting at a separate node), and the
master-worker pattern is illustrated. The board is the memory of the master
node.</p>
<p>Once students are used to the exercise, issues like task granularity and
load balancing can be discussed, along with communication overhead:</p>
<ul>
<li>If too many students are picked, too many students get up and move around,<br>
and the master has to work extra to send and receive all the extra messages.</li>
<li>If too few students helpers are picked, it may take a long time to compute the matrix.</li>
<li>If some students have more work than the others, then the time to complete the
computation of matrix C is dependent on the slowest student.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kitchen1992">Kitchen1992</h3>
<p>(Kitchen1992) talks about adding values in a matrix (e.g. each process/thread adds a column)
as a way to illustrate the Master-Worker pattern. However, the description does not go
into further detail.</p>
<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>
<p>The following variations are suggested:</p>
<p><strong>Matrix-Vector Multiplication</strong>: The above activity can easily be used to illustrate
matrix-vector multiplication by having the master assign each cell to a separate student helper
(or subset of cells) along with the common vector. To ensure that students can complete the multiplication in a
reasonable about of time, reduce the range of values in matrices A and B (say
to 1..5).</p>
<p><strong>Matrix Multiplication</strong>: The above activity can easily be used to illustrate
matrix multiplication by having the master assign rows in matrix A and B to a separate
student helper. To ensure that students can complete the multiplication in a
reasonable about of time, reduce the range of values in matrices A and B (say
to 1..5).</p>
<p><strong>Heterogeneous Distributed Architectures</strong>: For heterogeneous architectures,
push desks together to form &ldquo;multi-core&rdquo; nodes. Each group of desks has a large
piece of paper on it, signifying shared memory.</p>
<p>When the master sends a message, it is sent to the &ldquo;team leader&rdquo; at the desk,
who then splits the work to his or her team at adjacent desks
(representing individual threads). Each person in the team fills out the cells
in the matrix assigned to them. Once the paper is completely filled in, the
team leader takes the paper, and gives it to the master at the front of the
class, who fills in the associated cells in matrix C.</p>
<p>To illustrate a multi-core master node, simply have the student playing the master node select a set of
&ldquo;mini-masters&rdquo; to stand in front with them, and do an initial split of
the matrix (i.e. one row to a &ldquo;master&rdquo;). Then each master will send a subset
of their assigned cells to student team leaders at desks; the activity then
continues as normal.</p>

<h2 id="recommended-courses">Recommended Courses</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Moore covers the concept in a parallel processing lab, though it is not
clear which course the lab was used in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CS2/DSA/Systems</strong> While TCPP recommends that concepts such as matrix
multiplication can be introduced as early as CS2, they recommend that several
of the programming and algorithmic topics be covered in DSA. Architecture
topics (and the notion of hybrid programming) are suggested for a systems course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>This exercise requires movement. and may be difficult for students who are
mobility impaired. However, these students can be included in the distributed
portion of the exercise, as they can remain at their desk. Blind students
will need Braille cards associated with the numbers that they need add/multiply
handed to them. Teammates at the desk can hand them the appropriate cards.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Assessment of this particular exercise is unknown; (Moore2000) discusses the
impact of the parallel computing labs in her course. In general, students
responded to the labs positively, and felt that labs increased their knowledge
significantly.</p>
