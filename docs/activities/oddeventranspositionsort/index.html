<p>Originally Described by Adam Rifkin (Rifkin1994), with a separate
description by Michelle Moore (Moore2000). (Bachelis1994) also presents the
sort as a &ldquo;compare-exchange sort&rdquo;. We extrapolate on (Rifkin1994), since
it is well described.</p>
<p>No web-link to independent description available. However, (Sivilotti2003)
employed the exercise in a summer workshop for middle school girls, and
provided a write-up of the activity and slides associated with the

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>(Rifkin1994) designed the activity to take place in the course of the hour,
and was introduced to high school minority students in a workshop format.<br>
Prior to the exercise, students are given an overview of the concept of
sorting, and try to come up with ways to sort a collection of six random
numbers.</p>
<p>The instructor then splits the group into nine teams (of about the same size),
with three teams assigned to a separate supervisor. The supervisor will
then have one of the three teams perform bubble sort, the second perform
odd-even-transposition sort, and the last perform parallel radix sort
(described in a separate exercise).</p>
<p>Each group under the care of supervisor stands in three rows. Each row has
indices noted on the ground, indicating where students should stand, numbered
from 0 &hellip; <em>n</em>-1 where <em>n</em> is the number of students in each row. For
odd-even-transposition sort, even spots are marked in one color, while odd
spots are marked in another.</p>
<p>Each student at index <em>i</em> is handed a random number that corresponds to
the same index in a separate row.  Each row is then given its own set of
instructions, and they are instructed to follow the instructions specifically
(without talking) to sort the numbers.</p>
<p>The row in charge of odd-even-transposition sort performs the following set of
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>During the &ldquo;even&rdquo; phase, neighbors standing on the same colored spaces
denoting &ldquo;even&rdquo; compare their numbers to their neighbors on the left. If
their neighbor is less than them, they swap spaces with their neighbor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the &ldquo;odd&rdquo; phase, neighbors standing on the same colored spaces denoting
&ldquo;odd&rdquo; compare their numbers with their neighbor to the left. If their
neighbor&rsquo;s number is less than them, they swap places with their neighbor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are asked note that the round does not need to be coordinated by
group leaders, and to observe that that the list was becoming &ldquo;more sorted&rdquo;
with each phase. At the end of the exercise, students were asked to consider
the strengths and weaknesses of Odd-even-transposition sort, and why it was
a parallel algorithm, and how it compares to bubble sort.</p>
<h3 id="variants">Variants</h3>
<h4 id="moore2000">(Moore2000)</h4>
<p>(Moore2000) describes an example exercise that she presents in a parallel processing
lab. It is assumed that students know about the Bubble Sort algorithm ahead of
time. Odd Even Transposition Sort is a &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; version of bubble sort. In
this exercise, students are asked to physically simulate the multiple processors
performing the sort. The main difference from (Rifkin1994) is that students
stay <em>stationary</em>, while <em>cards</em> move around. This variant may be better for
classrooms with students with impaired mobility.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A subset of students stand in line at the front of classroom, and count off to determine
if they are odd or even. Each student who is even is marked with a sticker to
indicate that they belong to the &ldquo;even&rdquo; group. (Note that two colors of
stickers can be used in order to ensure that there are no hurt feelings). It
is important that &ldquo;even&rdquo; and &ldquo;odd&rdquo; alternate in the line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each student is handed an index card with a unique random number written on
it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the even phase, all the Evens turn to the left and compare their card
with their neighbor. If the neighbor&rsquo;s card number is smaller than the card they are
holding, they swap cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the odd phase, all the Odds turn to their left and compare their card
with their neighbors. If the neighbor&rsquo;s card number is smaller than the card
they are holding, they swap cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The above two phases are repeated until the numbers are in order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A separate student (not in line) is responsible for tallying the number of
times the odd phases and even phases occur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The class then has a discussion that Odd-Even Transposition Sort has a parallel
time complexity O(<em>n</em>) when <em>n</em> students are used for sorting. In
contrast, the serial algorithm (bubble sort) has a time complexity of
O(<em>n</em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<h4 id="sivilotti2003">Sivilotti2003</h4>
<p>Sivilotti performed the activity exactly as described in (Rifkin1994). However,
prior to introducing the activity, used an analogy to describe computers as
&ldquo;chefs&rdquo; and programs to &ldquo;recipes&rdquo;. Like programs, recipes are characterized
by what their ingredients (input) and the final product (output). A software
engineer is thus described as a &ldquo;recipe-engineer&rdquo;.</p>

that can be influenced by parallelism.</p>

<li>
<p>Know Sorting: Observe several sorting algorithms for varied platforms &mdash;
together with analyses. Parallel merge sort is the simplest example, but
equally simple alternatives for rings and meshes might be covered also;
more sophisticated algorithms might be covered in more advanced courses.</p>

<h2 id="recommended-courses">Recommended Courses</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Moore covers the concept in a parallel processing lab, though it is not
clear which course the lab was used in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>K-12</strong>: (Rifkin1994) successfully introduced sorting concepts to minority
high school students in a summer workshop. (Sivilotti2003) successfully
introduced sorting concepts to middle school girls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CS2/DSA</strong>: TCPP recommends that topics of sorting can be covered as
early as CS2, and that both sorting and algorithmic complexity topics are
appropriate for DSA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>This exercise appears fairly accessible to everyone. For students who are blind,
the Braille cards are recommended so students can read the number on them.
For Deaf students the &ldquo;Odd&rdquo; &ldquo;Even&rdquo; phases can be signified by holding up a
large sign. We do not anticipate any mobility issues, as students can sit in
chairs for this exercise, and perform the variant described in (Moore2000).
However, some groups may choose to use original description in (Rifkin1994)
to engage higher energy, able students.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>(Rifkin1994) gives a general overview of assessment; 81 students completed
surveys, in which they overwhelmingly responded that the workshop
as a whole was a positive experience, and that respondents &ldquo;learned something,
had fun, and had a better impression of computer science&rdquo; (Rifkin1994).
However, specific assessment of odd-even-transposition sort was not provided.</p>
<p>(Moore2000) discusses the impact of the parallel computing labs in her course. In general, students
responded to the labs positively, and felt that labs increased their knowledge
significantly.</p>
<p>(Sivilotti2003) reported the sorting activity could be completed in a 45 minute
period. Students were asked a number of questions, including rating the
exercises. On a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) students rated the parallel
sorting exercise as a 4.4. Students also made statements such as &ldquo;the more
&lsquo;chefs&rsquo;[processors] you use, the faster the program will finish&rdquo; and &ldquo;sequential programs
are slow&rdquo; (Sivilotti1999). Students were also asked to evaluate the overall
quality of the computer science module on scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), and
rated the cs component of the workshop as 4.6. Note that this includes other
activities.</p>
