<h2 id="original-author-link">Original Author/link</h2>

<p>Originally described by Yifat Ben-David Kolikant (Kolinkat2001). Modified for a
CS1 audience by Gary Lewandowski, Dennis Bouvier, Robert McCartney, Kate Sanders, and Beth Simon in 2007 (Lewandowski2007, Lewandowski2010)</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<h3 id="cs1-use-case">CS1 Use-Case</h3>

<p>The following scenario is presented to students entering CS1 on their first
day (Lewandowski2010):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose a Ticket Sale Company sells concert tickets in the following way:
When a customer calls and asks for a <em>n</em> seats, the seller (1) finds the <em>n</em>
best avaiable seats; (2) marks those <em>n</em> seats as unavailable; and  (3) deals with customer payment options and either e-mails ticket receipt
or sends tickets to the Will Call Box Office (lets customer pick up tickets
day of show). Now suppose there are two sellers working at the same time.
What problems could arise, and how can we avoid them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Students should be allowed to answer in whatever long-form way they choose.
This could be done electronically (through a text-box) or written down and
submitted.</p>

<p>If done in class, the authors suggest that instructors choose a subset of
student-generated solutions for further discussion. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the key problem? (a seat gets accidentally sold to multiple people).
This is called a &ldquo;race condition&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>Even in &ldquo;fast&rdquo; systems (blazingly fast sellers), it is possible to have
race conditions. It should be emphasized to students that race conditions
can occur despite speed.</p></li>

<li><p>Instructors can use responses that &ldquo;pass the buck&rdquo; (vendors can mark a seat
as unavailable and sell it instaneously). For these responses, let students
know that there can be delay that could occur between the time seats are
marked as unavailable and when they are sold. This is a good starting
point on a discussion of atomic operations.</p></li>

<li><p>Also ask students what would happen if a credit card payment did not go
through, or if the customer changes their mind (i.e. what if marking a seat
as reserved and purchasing it was not atomic)?</p></li>

<li><p>Instructors should use centralized solutions (sellers pass the
responsibility of making seat assignments to some centralized resource like
a database or where each seller had their own private set of seats that only
they sell) to discuss interleving instructions (e.g. how will one seller know
that another seller has reserved the seats?) or serializing the process.</p></li>

<li><p>Instructors should use solutions that do not scale well to discuss scaling
issues (e.g. only one vendor on a cell-phone is allowed in the concert hall
at any given time; at that point they get the &ldquo;best&rdquo; seats for their
customer, marks them as &ldquo;taken&rdquo; and leaves. The scaling issue arises as this
is not tenable for larger concert halls).</p></li>

<li><p>Instructors should stress the real-world applicability of this problem.
Ask the students where they have seen this in the real world.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="original-proposed-by-kolikant">Original Proposed by Kolikant</h3>

<p>The original was provided as an assignment by (Kolikant2001) to her students
on the first day of class in an upper-level concurrency course. The following
is reproduced from (Lewandowski2007) as a summary of what was proposed by
(Kolikant2001):</p>

<p>A ticket office sells movie tickets for a certain play. The next client always
gets the best avaialable ticket (each client can only purchase one ticket).
The vendor runs computer software that determines what is the next best
available seat, and prints the ticket for the client. This is equivalent to a
buttom push.</p>

<p>The following procedures are defined in the software:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
// returns index of best available seat in hall
// returns -1 if no seats are available
int bestAvailableSeat(Array Hall); 

//marks seat noted by the index as being &quot;taken&quot;. 
//once function completes, the seat is marked as being taken with customer's name.
void markAvailableSeat(int seat, string customer);

//prints a ticket associated with the index (has customer's name on it) 
void printTicket(int seat);
</code></pre>

<p>The software handles a client using the following set of steps:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
int seat = bestAvailableSeat(Hall);
if (seat != -1) {
    markAvailableSeat(seat);
    printTicket(seat);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The owners of the play decide to add another ticket office. Each ticket office
open at the same time and sell tickets for the same play. Each office has its
own printer for printing tickets.</p>

<p>Develop a system according to the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the required hardware? (screens, printers, keyboards, etc.). Specify
how the hardware is distributed in the system.</p></li>

<li><p>Write pseudocode for the software of the required system (where tickets are
being sold in two offices for the same play). You may use the procedures
defined above.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>CS1</strong>: (Lewandowski2007) taught the concepts in a CS1 course.</li>
<li><strong>CS2/Systems</strong>: TCPP recommends that consistency in distributed
transactions can be covered in CS2 and/or systems.</li>
<li><strong>DSA</strong>: In addition to systems, TCPP recommends that data races can be
covered in DSA.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

<p>This assignment seems generally accessible. For students who are blind, the
prompt needs to be made available in Braille or through a screen reader so that
students can give their answers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>(Kolikant2001) presented the problem as the first assignment in an upper-level
course on concurrency. Despite the differences in the solutions, Kolikant found
that she could classify all the responses into five main categories, including
three centralized solutions, and two decentralized solutions. Found that while
many students proposed centralized solutions, most failed to recognize the
race condition component.</p>

<p>(Lewandowski2007, Lewandowski2010) created a simpler, less programming specific
version which they presented to CS1 students as an open prompt. Students submitted
long form english-sentence paragraph answers, rather than psuedo-code. Unlike
(Kolikant2001), students in this populace submitted multiple solutions.
(Lewandowski2010) reports that with the more open-ended responses, 71% of students
came up with at least one &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; response, and most students (97%)
identified the main problem of interest (it may be possible to give a
a particular seat to more than one person). Both studies support the notion
of constructivism, which operates under the assumption that students learn by
refining and extending their own existing knowledge. Both sets of researchers
argue thatt &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; scenarios like the ticket system is preferable to
clever stories (Dining Philosophers, Sleeping Barbers, etc.).</p>
