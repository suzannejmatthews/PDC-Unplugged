<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>(Rifkin1994) designed the activity to take place in the course of the hour,
and was introduced to high school minority students in a workshop format.
Prior to the exercise, students are given an overview of the concept of
sorting, and try to come up with ways to sort a collection of six random
numbers.</p>
<p>The instructor then splits the group into nine teams (of about the same size),
with three teams assigned to a separate supervisor. The supervisor will then
have one of the three teams perform bubble sort, the second perform
odd-even-transposition sort (described in a <a href="https://www.pdcunplugged.org/activities/oddeventranspositionsort/">separate exercise</a> ), and the last
perform parallel radix sort.</p>
<p>Each team under the care of supervisor stands in a separate row.
Each row has indices noted on the ground, indicating where students should
stand, numbered from 0 … n-1 where n is the number of students in each row.
Each student at index i is handed a random number that corresponds to the
same index in a separate row. Each row is then given its own set of
instructions, and they are instructed to follow the instructions specifically
(without talking) to sort the numbers.</p>
<p>For parallel radix sort, the exercise is formed as a &ldquo;race&rdquo;, where the group
leader walks down the line with the student at space 0.</p>
<ul>
<li>The student at space 0 (or &ldquo;roving student&rdquo;), as they walk, reveals their
number to the other students standing in place.</li>
<li>Students standing in place (&ldquo;stationary students&rdquo;) keep track of a private
counter (which starts at 0). Whenever a stationary student sees a number
walk  pass that is <em>less</em> than their number, they increment their counter by
one.</li>
<li>As  the roving student passes by each stationary student, the stationary
student &ldquo;acknowledges&rdquo; the fact that they&rsquo;ve seen the number by raising
their hand, enabling the roving student to go to the next spot.</li>
<li>Once the roving student reaches the end of line, he or she returns to space 0.
The student at space 1 then becomes the roving student, while all other
students remain stationary. Starting at space 0, they walk down the line,
revealing their numbers to each stationary student, who raises their hand
in acknowledgment, and updates their private counters as needed.</li>
<li>The process continues until every student had an opportunity to walk down
the line.</li>
<li>Once everyone had the opportunity to walk down the line, the group leader
indicates that everyone should simultaneously leave the space they were
standing and go to the same space indicated by their private counter. After
doing this, the numbers should be now be sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The smallest number will have had a private counter of 0, and will stand
in space 0, as they never encountered a number that was smaller. The next
smallest number will be at space 1, and so forth.</p>
<p>Students are asked to think why the list should be sorted at the end of
Parallel Radix Sort.</p>
<h3 id="variants-sivilotti2003">Variants (Sivilotti2003)</h3>
<p>Sivilotti performed the activity exactly as described in (Rifkin1994). However,
prior to introducing the activity, used an analogy to describe computers as
&ldquo;chefs&rdquo; and programs to &ldquo;recipes&rdquo;. Like programs, recipes are characterized
by what their ingredients (input) and the final product (output). A software
engineer is thus described as a &ldquo;recipe-engineer&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Comprehend Asymptotics: Understand upper (big-O) and lower bounds
(big-Omega,); follow elementary big-O analyses, e.g., the O(log n)
tree-depth argument for merge-sort with unbounded parallelism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehend Time: Recognize time as a fundamental computational resource that
can be influenced by parallelism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehend Speedup: Recognize the use of parallelism either to solve a given
problem instance faster or to solve larger instance in the same time
(strong and weak scaling).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know Sorting: Observe several sorting algorithms for varied platforms -
together with analyses. Parallel merge sort is the simplest example,
but equally simple alternatives for rings and meshes might be covered also;
more sophisticated algorithms might be covered in more advanced courses.</p>

<h2 id="recommended-courses">Recommended Courses</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>K-12</strong>: (Rifkin1994) successfully introduced sorting concepts to minority
high school students in a summer workshop. (Sivilotti2003) successfully
introduced the activity to middle school girls in a 45-minute format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CS2/DSA</strong>: TCPP recommends that topics of sorting can be covered as early
as CS2, and that both sorting and algorithmic complexity topics are
appropriate for DSA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>The exercise may be difficult for students who are mobility-impaired, or have
trouble with visual. Cards can have Braille on them, so when a blind student
plays the stationary student role, he or she can reach out and touch the card
to read the value. Verbal acknowledgments may be most appropriate when the
blind student acts as the roving student in the exercise. Verbal
acknowledgments may also be preferable to students who have trouble raising
their hands.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>(Rifkin1994) gives a general overview of assessment; 81 students completed
surveys, in which they overwhelmingly responded that the workshop as a whole
was a positive experience, and that respondents “learned something, had fun,
and had a better impression of computer science” (Rifkin1994). However,
specific assessment of parallel radix sort was not provided.</p>
<p>(Sivilotti2003) reported the sorting activity could be completed in a 45 minute
period. Students were asked a number of questions, including rating the
exercises. On a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) students rated the parallel
sorting exercise as a 4.4. Students also made statements such as &ldquo;the more
&lsquo;chefs&rsquo;[processors] you use, the faster the program will finish&rdquo; and &ldquo;sequential
are slow&rdquo; (Sivilotti1999). Students were also asked to evaluate the overall
quality of the computer science module on scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), and
rated the cs component of the workshop as 4.6. Note that this includes other
activities.</p>
